# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the
motivation behind your project?

Do we really have the freedom to vote on what we want to?

Our project follows this central question about democracy in Switzerland.
Our primary data source for this are the archives of the Swiss newspaper 'Le Temps',
which regroups data from three different newspapers from the past 200 years.
We want to see what kind of patterns we can see that surround Swiss voting
themes of the past and the present. Are we continuously voting on the same questions?
Do our answers to these questions change? What about entirely new themes? In
the last 200 years, life in Switzerland has radically changed, we would expect
this to be reflected in the topics that have been voted on. Especially with
regards to technological development and social norms. How has the voting
process in Switzerland been used to bring in these new changes under Swiss law?
The archives from 'Le Temps' will serve as our reference, we will try to
make a comparison with present day trends using the Swiss tweets dataset.

# Research questions
* Do we have the freedom to vote on any question we wish?
* Do the same votations, or topics, keep coming up? Is this throughout history
or during specific periods?
* Can we link big changes in technological and societal norms to previous votations?
* How has direct democracy been used? Is it increasing or decreasing? What kind
of votations is it used for?

# Dataset
The main dataset we want to use are the archives Le Temps. After talking with
Giovanni we understand that these will be available on the cluster in a
processed from, with the articles available as strings and images. Although
the archives are enormous, we will only be using the fraction of them that is
related to voting. A lot of the work of this project will be related to
string handling and processing. We'll also need to learn how to work on the
cluster, including how we will be querying the archives and sorting throug
them.

Our seconday dataset will be the collection of Swiss tweets. We'll also
be performing a lot of similar string handling and processing. We expect
there will also be metadata to analyse. However, as the dataset is not available
yet we haven't been able to inspect its contents. Both datasets are available
on the cluster, which should simplify the workflow.
