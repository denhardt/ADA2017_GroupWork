    "### Lemmatisation\n",
    "We will be using the NLP library `spacy` to clean articles into more usable data. We'll be doing a lot of lemmatisation, whereby all words are reduced to a 'root' form, removing conjugation, pre- and suffixes and other such inflected forms. This will make it much easier to compare words between articles, as inflected forms will be transformed into the same lemma comparable across texts. For example, the words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> voter, votation, votons, vote, voté\n",
    "\n",
    "Will all be changed to the same 'root' word **voter**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive selection\n",
    "We next want to filter out articles which are not clearly in direct link to voting. Although we could have done a round of clustering to identify topics and then choose only those from the 'voting' cluster, we felt it better to use a combination of lemmatisation and 'naive selection', whereby articles are filtered depending on whether they contain any one of a list of keywords in relation to voting. The issue with performing clustering at this stage would be precision. We would then be performing two rounds of clustering, 1 to identify articles on voting, and another to identify the topics of these articles. We would rather sacrifice on recall and have higher precision early on so that we are sure that all selected articles are definitely on voting. Based on some initial trials, we found that it was an issue if non-voting articles made it to our later round of clustering, where it would throw off the clustering. Furthermore, the naive selection still left us with a large number of articles, several hundreds per year, which we decided was enough for our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we chose to do the naive selection before lemmatisation for performance reasons. We can surely increase the number of articles that we obtain without reducing precision if we perform the selection on lemmatised articles."

    "> Do the same votations, or topics, keep coming up? Is this throughout history or during specific periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question we would first perform LDA on our entire set filtered with our votation keywords. We would then compare date distributions of articles in different clusters. By seeing these distributions, we should be able to determine if certain topics were only being voted on at a certain point in the last 200 years, or if they regularly re-appear.\n",

Then we would compare this with LDA on a set of our data which is filtered with keywords relating only to the direct-democracy 'initiatives populaires'. We may first simply compare the size of these two sets over time, seeing if there are more or less 'initiatives populaires' throughout time. By comparing the topics that may be missing or not as represented in one set we may also draw some conclusions as to how direct democracy has been used, specifically on which topics or area of topics.\n",
