This enforces the 'clichÃ©' that German speakers are more prone to work than people from the latin culture, at least if we look at unemployment rates. It also seems the boundary cantons are sitting in the middle with intermediate unemployment in relation either side of the RÃ¶stigraben. The Tessin is also in its own region, somewhere between the Romand and boundary cantons. We'll notice that we conserve the East/Weast trend that we previously observed when looking on a per-canton basis. "
